This project builds a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using **Logistic Regression**. It includes full preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps, making it a strong baseline for real-world fraud detection use cases.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes transactional and customer data:
- `trans_date_trans_time`, `unix_time`
- `merchant`, `category`, `amount`
- `gender`, `city`, `state`, `lat`, `long`, `dob`, `job`
- `merch_lat`, `merch_long`, `city_pop`
- `is_fraud` (Target variable: 1 = Fraud, 0 = Legit)

> **Note:** Columns like `cc_num`, `zip`, and `Unnamed: 0` were removed during preprocessing due to irrelevance or duplication.

---

## 🧪 Project Pipeline

### ✅ 1. Preprocessing
- Converted `trans_date_trans_time` to datetime
- Extracted `year`, `month`, `day`, and `hour`
- Dropped redundant or personal identifier columns
- One-hot encoded categorical variables
- Imputed missing values in numerical features

### ✅ 2. Modeling
- Used a `Pipeline` from `scikit-learn` to combine preprocessing and model training
- Applied `LogisticRegression` for binary classification
- Split dataset into 80% training and 20% test sets

### ✅ 3. Evaluation
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report with Precision, Recall, F1-score

## 🧠 Tools & Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn** for modeling
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Explore advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Nets)
- Use SMOTE or class weighting for imbalanced datasets
- Add behavioral feature engineering (spending patterns, frequency)
- Implement deployment-ready REST API for real-time predictions
